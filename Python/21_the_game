# 21 game
""" 
    Just a simple game 21, against imitation of bot

    Rule is simple. 
    You need to score 21 points or more points than bot

    The game goes on until the player writes no in the console.
    Programm consist of three functions:
    1) game_batch() - game round funcction. It`s responsible for who will go first and who wins according to the total points scored.
    2) human() - player`s function. It`s responsible for which cards a person has and whether he wants to take even more cards or not.
    3) bot() - Imitation of bot function. It works just a programm which stops typing cards when sum of cards(numbers) can be greater than 21.
       When ace drops out (1 or 11), if sum+11 >= 21 ace will be equal to 1.

    To stop the game, you must write "no" in the console when programm will ask you 'Do you want to play one more time ?)(yes/no): '
